# CODES - UVa

Those are codes related to programming contests and they are in [UVa Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org).

## STRUCTURE

Each folder has a number which is the identifier of the problema on UVa website.
Inside of the folder we have two files Main.cpp and test.txt.

## EXECUTING

To run the problems you just have to 
```
g++ Main.cpp
```
And
```
./a.out < test.txt
```

## ABOUT

I am an iOS Developer, besides that most of those codes are written in C++, because I want to learn a new language and learning is always cool!!!!
